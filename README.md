### PURPOSE :
TO PREDICT THE STOCK PRICE OF A COMPANY USING LSTM.

#### ABOUT DATASET

Google Stock Prediction

This dataset contains historical data on Google's stock prices and related attributes. It consists of 14 columns and a smaller subset of 1257 rows. Each column represents a specific attribute, and each row contains the corresponding values for that attribute.

The columns in the dataset are as follows:

1. **Symbol**: The name of the company, which is **GOOG** in this case.
2. **Date**: The year and date of the stock data.
3. **Close**: The closing price of Google's stock on a particular day.
4. **High**: The highest value reached by Google's stock on the given day.
5. **Low**: The lowest value reached by Google's stock on the given day.
6. **Open**: The opening value of Google's stock on the given day.
7. **Volume**: The trading volume of Google's stock on the given day, i.e., the number of shares traded.
8. **adjClose**: The adjusted closing price of Google's stock, considering factors such as dividends and stock splits.
9. **adjHigh**: The adjusted highest value reached by Google's stock on the given day.
10. **adjLow**: The adjusted lowest value reached by Google's stock on the given day.
11. **adjOpen**: The adjusted opening value of Google's stock on the given day.
12. **adjVolume**: The adjusted trading volume of Google's stock on the given day, accounting for factors such as stock splits.
13. **divCash**: The amount of cash dividend paid out to shareholders on the given day.
14. **splitFactor**: The split factor, if any, applied to Google's stock on the given day. A split factor of 1 indicates no split.

## TASK 2: NUMBER RECOGNITION

### PURPOSE : TO DETECT THE SCANNED IMAGES OF HANDWRITTEN DIGITS USING A NEURAL NETWORK

#### About Dataset

MNIST Handwritten Digits

The MNIST dataset is a widely recognized and fundamental dataset in the field of computer vision and machine learning. It serves as a benchmark for developing and testing various image classification algorithms. MNIST stands for Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology, and it contains a collection of grayscale images of handwritten digits.

Key Attributes of the MNIST Dataset:

**Image Data**: MNIST consists of 70,000 28x28 pixel images of handwritten digits. These images are grayscale, meaning they have only one channel (as opposed to RGB images with three channels).

**Label Data**: Each of the 70,000 images is associated with a corresponding label, which indicates the digit that the image represents. The labels range from 0 to 9, corresponding to the ten possible digits.

**Training and Testing Sets**: The dataset is typically split into two parts: a training set and a testing set. The training set, consisting of 60,000 images, is used to train machine learning models. The testing set, with 10,000 images, is reserved for evaluating the model's accuracy.

The MNIST dataset is a valuable resource for data analysts, machine learning engineers, and researchers, as it offers a well-defined task—digit recognition—and a relatively small size that makes it accessible for experimenting with various algorithms.
